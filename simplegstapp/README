# How to add and compile a sampe plugin on Ubuntu  

The code is based on https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-template.git. You are not required to download this package.
The example plugin + template plugins are part of this repository. Below is the list of instructions to compile 

1) cd <path to sample plugin repo>/gst-template/gst-plugin
2) export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib
3) ./autogen.sh
4) cd src
5) make
6) sudo make install

# Run with new plugin
gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=<path to video>/SampleVid.mp4 ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! myplugin ! autovideosink

# Notes
1) This is tested on ubunu 18.04.1 LTS and ubunut 16.04 LTS
2) Changes to Makefile.am include 
    a) addition lines for myplugin
    b) replacing string "audiofilterexample" to "audiofiltertemplateplugin" to match the name in file gstaudiofilter.c GST_PLUGIN_DEFINE macro/function(3rd parameter). This change is required for ubuntu 18.04, but the name mismatch looks ok for ubuntu 16.04

# other notes
export GST_DEBUG=6 (enable log, debug, info, fixme, warning, error) refer https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/debugging-tools.html
video used is also part of this repo!
